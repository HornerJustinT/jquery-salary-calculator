# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

This is a salary calculator web app developed primarily through javascript, jquery, bootstrap, css, and html. The app has a form input to add a employee to a table on the DOM. There is a budget that is appended to the webpage based on the inputs put in by the user. If the budget is above a certain point, in this case 20,000 a warning pops up on the page. A person can also be deleted from the table by the delete me button. After adding a person or deleting a person, the budget and warning will update based on what is now on the table. I made this website primarily to become comfortable with jquery and interactivty inside a website. I also wanted to try using bootstrap in a web app.
